    "### CountVectorizer for text classification\n",
    "It's time to begin building your text classifier! The data has been loaded into a DataFrame called df. Explore it in the IPython Shell to investigate what columns you can use. The .head() method is particularly informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll use pandas alongside *scikit-learn* to create a sparse text vectorizer you can use to train and test a simple supervised model. To begin, you'll set up a CountVectorizer and investigate some of its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Instructions\n",
    "- Import CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text and train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.\n",
    "- Create a Series y to use for the labels by assigning the .label attribute of df to y.\n",
    "- Using df[\"text\"] (features) and y (labels), create training and test sets using train_test_split(). Use a test_size of 0.33 and a random_state of 53.\n",
    "- Create a CountVectorizer object called count_vectorizer. Ensure you specify the keyword argument stop_words=\"english\" so that stop words are removed.\n",
    "- Fit and transform the training data X_train using the .fit_transform() method of your CountVectorizer object. Do the same with the test data X_test, except using the .transform() method.\n",
    "- Print the first 10 features of the count_vectorizer using its .get_feature_names() method."
